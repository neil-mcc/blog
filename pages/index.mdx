Hey, I'm Neil - a frontend engineer from Northern Ireland who loves building fast, user-friendly web experiences. Over the past few years, I've worked on everything from design systems to large-scale applications, always focused on making the web more accessible, performant, and enjoyable to use.

I care about the details: clean code, intuitive UX, smooth animations, and the seamless handoff between design and development. My goal is to build things that not only work well, but feel great to use.

### What I Do

**Frontend Development** – I specialize in modern web technologies including React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Angular. I build responsive, performant interfaces that work beautifully across all devices.

**UI Engineering** – Creating accessible, polished user interfaces using modern styling solutions like Tailwind CSS, and component libraries such as shadcn/ui. I focus on design systems that scale.

**Team Leadership** – I help teams write better code, improve workflows, and ship quality products. I believe in leading by example and fostering collaborative environments.

**Design Collaboration** – Working closely with designers using tools like Figma to turn high-fidelity prototypes into production-ready applications with pixel-perfect precision.

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS-in-JS, Sass
- **State Management**: React Query, Redux, Context API
- **Tools**: Git, Figma, Vercel, Prisma
- **Practices**: Agile methodologies, Component-driven development, Accessibility standards

### Beyond Code

When I'm not writing code, I'm spending time with my family, learning guitar, or cheering on Manchester United (the greatest football team in the world, naturally).
