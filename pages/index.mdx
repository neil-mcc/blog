# Neil McClelland

Hey, I’m Neil — a frontend engineer from Northern Ireland who loves building fast, user-friendly web experiences. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on everything from design systems to large-scale apps, always aiming to make the web a little smoother and a lot more enjoyable to use.

I care about the details — clean code, great UX, solid performance, and a smooth handoff between design and development. I like figuring out how to make things not just work, but work beautifully.

### What I’m Good At

Leading by example – helping teams write better code, improve workflows, and build things we can be proud of.

UI craftsmanship – creating clean, accessible interfaces that look good and feel fast on any device.

Teamwork – collaborating with designers, product folks, and backend engineers to get ideas from sketch to production.

Systems thinking – setting up component libraries and front-end structures that scale as projects grow.

Quality mindset – keeping an eye on performance, accessibility, and long-term maintainability.

### Technical Expertise
- Front-End Development: Skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with understanding of frameworks like React and Angular. I thrive on building responsive and dynamic user experiences that stand out from the crowd.
- Design & Prototyping: Proficient in using Figma for creating high-fidelity prototypes that serve as a blueprint for the final product.
- Collaboration & Version Control: Adept in working within cross-functional teams using Agile methodologies, and proficient in Git for version control, ensuring smooth and efficient project progression.

### Philosophy & Hobbies
Outside of tech my days are filled by spending time with my wife Ciara and young daughter Alanna, learning to play the guitar and following the greatest football team in the world Manchester United.

### Let's Connect!
I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and collaborations that push the envelope of what's possible in UI design. If you're interested in starting a project, let's connect!
