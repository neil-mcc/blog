# Neil McClelland

Hi! I'm Neil, a Front-End Software Engineer from Northern Ireland.

### Professional Journey
My adventure in the tech industry began 4 years ago after graduating from Ulster University with a first class degree in Computer Science.

Since gratuating I have worked as a UI Software Engineer at SAP, helping to build an innovating data and security product.

### Technical Expertise
- Front-End Development: Skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with understanding of frameworks like React and Angular. I thrive on building responsive and dynamic user experiences that stand out from the crowd.
- Design & Prototyping: Proficient in using Figma for creating high-fidelity prototypes that serve as a blueprint for the final product.
- Collaboration & Version Control: Adept in working within cross-functional teams using Agile methodologies, and proficient in Git for version control, ensuring smooth and efficient project progression.

### Philosophy & Hobbies
Outside of tech my days are filled by spending time with my wife Ciara and young daughter Alanna, learning to play the guitar and following the greatest football team in the world Manchester United.

### Let's Connect!
I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and collaborations that push the envelope of what's possible in UI design. If you're interested in starting a project, let's connect! You can reach me at neilmcclelland1@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-mcclelland-118a06107/).
